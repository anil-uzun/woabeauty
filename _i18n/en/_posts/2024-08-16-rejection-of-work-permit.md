            According to Article 9(a) of the International Labor Law, applications that do not comply with international labor policy are rejected. International labor policy is fundamentally based on the following principles:<br>
                <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>Policies developed to prioritize domestic labor in meeting Turkey's labor needs, as well as maintaining the sustainability of national employment policies, while ensuring a balance between local and foreign labor and benefiting from qualified foreign labor.<br>
                <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>Attracting highly qualified foreign labor who stand out in education level, professional experience, contributions to science and technology, and strategic importance in specific fields.<br>
                <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>Attracting highly qualified foreign investors to Turkey based on the size of investment, contribution to employment and economy, employment level, export volume, contribution to the region, province, or sector, and other similar factors.<br>
                <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>Implementation of international labor policy domestically and internationally through projects, plans, programs, and similar activities carried out by the General Directorate, and coordination with relevant institutions and organizations when necessary.<br>
            International labor policy is determined according to the above principles. In this sense, a work permit application that is found to be in violation of these principles will be rejected.

    According to Article 9(e) of the International Labor Law, work permit applications are rejected if they do not meet the evaluation criteria set by the Ministry. Both the foreign applicant and the employer who will employ the foreigner must meet these criteria. The Ministry’s evaluation criteria for employers and foreigners are as follows:<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>At least 5 Turkish citizens must be employed at the workplace where the work permit is requested. If the foreigner requesting the permit is a company partner, the requirement for five employees is applied only to the last 6 months of a one-year work permit granted by the Ministry. In cases where multiple foreign work permit requests are made at the same workplace, each foreigner after the first one granted a work permit must have 5 Turkish citizens employed separately.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>The workplace must have a paid-in capital of at least 100,000 TL or gross sales of at least 800,000 TL or an export amount of at least 250,000 USD in the last year.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>For foreigners working in associations and foundations, the criteria of Article 2 will apply. For foreigners working in foreign airline representations in Turkey, the education sector, and domestic services, Articles 1 and 2 will not apply.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>The foreign company partner requesting the permit must have a capital share of at least 20% and not less than 40,000 TL.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>The declared monthly salary for the foreigner must be at a level commensurate with the foreigner's duties and qualifications. Accordingly, considering the minimum wage applicable at the time of application, the salary to be paid to the foreigner must be at least:
    </p>
    <div class="ml-3 mt-1 mb-1">
        <o><b>-</b></o>6.5 times the minimum wage for top executives and pilots<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>4 times the minimum wage for unit or branch managers, engineers, and architects<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>3 times the minimum wage for jobs requiring specialization and expertise, and for teachers<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>The minimum wage for foreigners working in domestic services, and 1.5 times the minimum wage for foreigners working in other professions<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>2 times the minimum wage for foreigners working in tourism-animation organization companies, including acrobats and similar roles, and for jobs like masseurs, masseuses, and SPA therapists<br>
        </div>
    <p>
    For entities:
    <div class="ml-3 mt-1 mb-1">
        <o><b>-</b></o>Tourism businesses with at least three stars certified by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, certified holiday villages, and thermal hotels with activity permits from official authorities<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Certified tourism establishments with a hamam-sauna-SPA complex, in agreement (contracted) facilities<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Officially authorized sports centers employing at least 20 Turkish citizens<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Requests to employ foreigners in jobs requiring specialization and expertise such as masseurs, masseuses, and SPA therapists will be considered, while requests from establishments not meeting these criteria will be deemed inappropriate.<br>
    </div>
    </p>
    <p>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>For foreigners employed in the entertainment sector and in tourism-animation organization companies in jobs requiring specialization and expertise, the quota for employing 5 Turkish citizens separately for each foreigner will not apply if at least 10 Turkish citizens are employed.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>For foreigners to be employed in cases specified in bilateral or multilateral agreements to which Turkey is a party, and for foreigners employed in public institution and organization procurement or service contracts, the criteria in Articles 1 and 2 will not apply.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>For jobs requiring advanced technology or in cases where there are no Turkish experts with the same qualifications, the criteria in Articles 1 and 2 will not apply upon approval from the General Directorate.<br>
    <o class="fas fa-caret-right"></o>For foreigners to be employed in enterprises meeting the conditions of Special Direct Foreign Investment, excluding key personnel, the criteria set in Article 1 will be applied based on the number of Turkish citizens employed across all workplaces of the enterprise in the country.<br>
    Persons not meeting the above evaluation criteria will have their work permit applications rejected. However, there are some foreigners who are exempt from these criteria. These foreigners are required to obtain work permits. Exempt foreigners include:
    </p>
    <div class="ml-3 mt-1 mb-1">
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners with a Turkish citizen parent, spouse, or child<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners who have been married to a Turkish citizen for at least 3 years<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Citizens of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners granted residence permits under Turkish or related community practices<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners granted humanitarian residence permits<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners granted residence permits as victims of human trafficking<br>
        <o><b>-</b></o>Foreigners granted residence permits as stateless individuals<br>
    </div>

    The above-mentioned foreigners will not have their work permit applications rejected if they apply, and they will be exempt from the evaluation criteria. However, they must prove their status with official documents.
